The combination produces a tropical aroma of pineapples and citrus fruit with a sharp pungent note reminiscent of Pine Sol.  The flavor of Dirty Girl is like sweet lemon candy and the effects it produces are happy and creative. Dirty Girl will elevate your mood and help avoid the complications of depression, anxiety, and migraine headaches.","flavors":"1. Sweet, 2. Pine, 3.
