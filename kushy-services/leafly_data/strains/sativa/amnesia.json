{"name":"Amnesia","description":"Amnesia is typically a sativa-dominant cannaibs strain with some variation between breeders. Skunk, Cinderella 99, and Jack Herer are some of Amnesia’s genetic forerunners, passing on uplifting, creative, and euphoric effects ideal for treating mood disorders. Growers should expect a 9-10 week flowering period with moderate yields. This strain normally has a high THC and low CBD profile and produces intense psychotropic effects that new consumers should be wary of. ","flavors":"1. Earthy, 2. Sweet, 3.
