{"name":"Jack's Cleaner","description":"Bred by TGA Subcool, this sativa-dominant hybrid is a cross between Jack Herer and The Cleaner, a strain with roots from Pluton, Lambâ€™s Bread, Purple Haze, and Northern Lights. Its overpowering lemon pungency and strong yellow appearance can be attributed to its Cleaner genetics. This plant flowers in 6 to 8 weeks, returning high yields with impressive potency. Although the strain initially induces sativa effects, the high potency makes this hybrid appropriate for day and night time use.","flavors":"1. Sweet, 2. Citrus, 3.
