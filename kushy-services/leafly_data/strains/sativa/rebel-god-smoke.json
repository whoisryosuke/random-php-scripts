{"name":"Rebel God Smoke","description":"Rebel God Smoke is a pro-grade sativa-dominant strain that blasts users with the motivating energy of a launching warhead. This rocket fuel, bred by Coloardo Seed Inc., is a cross of Cinderella 99 and Gupta Kush and has been known to finish flowering in under 8 weeks. The plant should smell of red currant and cabernet with just a hint of fuel on the rim. Use this strain with caution, as it can overstimulate even the most seasoned cannabis veteran.   ","flavors":"","lineage":"","grow_metrics":"","attributes_title":"Uplifted, Euphoric, Energetic, Focused, Happy","attributes_num":"width:100%, width:100%, width:50%, width:50%, width:50%"}
