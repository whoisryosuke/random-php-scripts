{"name":"Kona Gold","description":"Kona Gold is a sativa strain that has traveled far from its native origin, the volcanic soils of Hawaiiâ€™s Big Island. Soaring cerebral-focused euphoria captures the mind while leaving the body light and functional, making this sativa a perfect pair with or replacement for your morning cup of coffee. A tropical medley of pineapple and citrus flavors are cut by a sharp sour aroma that could almost be compared to diesel fuel. The authentic Kona Gold is unique to its mineral-rich homeland, but its replications overseas still have much to offer sativa enthusiasts.","flavors":"1. Tropical, 2. Sweet, 3.
