{"name":"Timewreck","description":"Bred by TGA Genetics, Timewreck is a 70% sativa cross between Vortex and Blood Wreck (Chernobyl x Qrazy Train). The sour, fruity flavors of Vortex enliven Trainwreck’s subtle earthy aromas with pungent notes of lemon, lime, sandalwood, and pear. Timewreck’s High Times Cup-winning THC content delivers potent relief to severe medical symptoms, but novice consumers should be wary of this sativa’s intensity. In large doses, Timewreck induces a disorienting euphoria that begins to justify this strain’s name, but smaller amounts are more likely to bring on engaged creativity and energy. Timewreck typically produces moderate indoor yields following its 60 to 70 day flowering time.","flavors":"1. Lemon, 2. Lime, 3.
