{"name":"Great White Shark","description":"Great White Shark is a potent strain that is known for its ability to provide a strong indica body buzz very quickly. For this reason it’s often recommended medically to treat chronic pain ailments. The sativa qualities of this strain keep this heavy hitter from being a complete knockout, but it isn’t recommended for days when a lot of work needs to get done. Great White Shark plants grow best indoors and will flower between 8 and 10 weeks. It has a strong fruity aroma that also alludes to its Super Skunk lineage. The buds themselves should be examples of the “white” part of its moniker, with a blanket of crystals and burnt orange to brown hairs. Also known as Peacemaker or just White Shark, this strain won the 1997 High Times Cannabis Cup.","flavors":"1. Earthy, 2. Citrus, 3.
