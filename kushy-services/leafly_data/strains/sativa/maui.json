{"name":"Maui","description":"A relative to Hawaiian sativa strains, Maui lives up to its tropical reputation. The musky overtones for this easy sativa are complemented by its fruity aftertaste and floral aroma. Less uplifting than other sativas, Maui tends to be head heavy and delivers a slow cerebral sensation that becomes more prominent over time. Maui effects tend to be medium-long in duration, lasting over 2 hours for many users.","flavors":"1. Citrus, 2. Tropical, 3.
