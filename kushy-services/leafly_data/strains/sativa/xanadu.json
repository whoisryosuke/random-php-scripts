{"name":"Xanadu","description":"Xanadu, named after the extravagant palace of Mongol emperor Kublai Khan, is sativa-dominant strain that delivers soaring cerebral euphoria alongside a skunky, citrus aroma. Bred by Dutchgrown Seeds, Xanadu combines a Pakistani indica called X-18 with DTC99, a Cinderella 99 and Durban Thai hybrid. Although this sativa tends to induce heady, high-energy stimulation, Xanadu anchors itself with mellow relaxation that allows one to remain comfortable during the effects' duration.","flavors":"1.
