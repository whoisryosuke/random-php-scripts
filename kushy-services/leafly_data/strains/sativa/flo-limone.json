{"name":"Flo Limone","description":"Flo Limone is Colorado Seed’s twist on a cannabis classic. Flo, the 1996 Cannabis Cup winner known for its light and bright buzz, is crossed against Nina Limone (Super Lemon Haze x Rebel God Smoke) to create an outstanding, full-flavored sativa that is motivating without an aggressive raciness. The terpene profile has also been described as aroma therapeutic, with notes of citrus incense intermixed with Moroccan hash. ","flavors":"","lineage":"","grow_metrics":"","attributes_title":"Happy, Focused, Relaxed, Creative, Giggly, Lack of Appetite, Fatigue, Insomnia, Pain, Stress","attributes_num":"width:100%, width:89.4736842105263%, width:89.4736842105263%, width:73.6842105263158%, width:63.1578947368421%, width:100%, width:40%, width:40%, width:40%, width:40%"}
