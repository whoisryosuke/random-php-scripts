{"name":"Bediol","description":"Bediol by Canadian LP Bedrocan is a sativa-dominant strain with a balanced cannabinoid profile of 6.5% THC and 8% CBD. This almost even split caters to a variety of patient needs, including relief of pain, inflammation, anxiety, and nausea. Due to its heightened levels of CBD, Bediol provides a subdued high that is less euphoric and more relaxing. Still, those sensitive to THC should mind their dose.Â ","flavors":"1. Earthy, 2.
