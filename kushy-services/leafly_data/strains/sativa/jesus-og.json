{"name":"Jesus OG","description":"Jesus OG was bred by TGA Subcool Seeds as the not-so-immaculate conception of Hell’s Angel OG and Jack the Ripper (talk about an “unholy” parentage). Jesus OG proves to be a godsend for growers and produces tall plants and heavy yields. Users enjoy the lemony kush aroma of this sativa-dominant hybrid, along with heavy effects that relax the body while leaving the mind functional and clear.","flavors":"1.
