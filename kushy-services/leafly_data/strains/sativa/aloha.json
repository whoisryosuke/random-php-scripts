{"name":"Aloha","description":"Aloha is a sativa strain that leaves users with an upbeat, energetic buzz and may also be helpful in treating pain such as migraines. Alohaâ€™s flowers will be large and fluffy, with plenty of room for white wispy hairs and sparkling crystals. The aroma of this strain is that of grass and citrus for a fresh experience that may have you thinking of your next island getaway. Its sativa effects can be a little much for some users, so those who are looking for less mental stimulation should be warned.","flavors":"1. Tropical, 2. Sweet, 3.
