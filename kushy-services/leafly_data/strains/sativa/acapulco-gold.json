{"name":"Acapulco Gold","description":"One of the most well-known strains, Acapulco Gold has been likened to dinner at a five-star restaurant. The strain comes from the areas in and around Acapulco, Mexico. Its orange hairs resemble a gold nugget, with gold, green, and brown colors of resin collecting on the buds. An aroma of burnt toffee lingers when the bud is broken up. Acapulco Gold has a reputation for being one of the best cannabis strains ever created, and is becoming more difficult to find due to more growers moving indoors. ","flavors":"1.
