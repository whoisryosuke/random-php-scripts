{"name":"Doug's Varin","description":"Doug’s Varin is a rare sativa strain that was specially crafted to contain high amounts of the cannabinoid THCV, a psychoactive cannabis compound known to relieve panic attacks, Parkinson’s tremors, stimulate bone growth, and provide a burst of energy. Patient’s suffering from anorexia and appetite loss should steer clear of Doug’s Varin, as THCV also suppresses hunger. With an aroma of earthy pine and sweet citrus, Doug’s Varin delivers a clear-headed burst of mental stimulation that doesn’t last as long as high-THC varieties, making this strain a perfect choice for anyone seeking short-term effects.","flavors":"","lineage":"","grow_metrics":"","attributes_title":"Uplifted, Creative, Energetic, Focused, Talkative, Fatigue, Depression, Inflammation, Stress, Eye Pressure","attributes_num":"width:100%, width:100%, width:100%, width:100%, width:77.4193548387097%, width:100%, width:61.2903225806452%, width:61.2903225806452%, width:61.2903225806452%, width:38.7096774193548%"}
