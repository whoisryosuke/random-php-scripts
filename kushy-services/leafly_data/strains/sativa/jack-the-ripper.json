{"name":"Jack the Ripper","description":"Jack the Ripper, or JTR, is the flagship hybrid from TGA Genetics and was created by the breeder Subcool in an attempt make his famous Jack’s Cleaner in seed form. Described by many as the fastest lemon Haze available to date, it was created by crossing the Jack’s Cleaner clone with a vigorous Space Queen male known as Space Dude. Featuring incredibly resinous triangle-shaped buds and an intense spicy, lemon-pine aroma, Jack the Ripper is a relatively short 70% sativa-dominant strain that usually tests over 20% THC. The effect is intense, visually stimulating, and can sometimes leave novice consumers disoriented and paranoid.","flavors":"1. Lemon, 2. Citrus, 3.
