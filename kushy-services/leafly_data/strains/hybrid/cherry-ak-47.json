With its reddish-purple characteristics and cherry aroma, it's no wonder how Cherry AK-47 got its name. The buds have gold coloring with lime-green leaves layered with trichome heads. This strain's flavors are described as smooth cherry with a creamy sandalwood aftertaste. With a THC level of up to 16% and a CBD level of 0.5%, Cherry AK-47 \"creeps\" up from a cerebral effect to a complete body sensation. ","flavors":"1. Sweet, 2. Berry, 3.
