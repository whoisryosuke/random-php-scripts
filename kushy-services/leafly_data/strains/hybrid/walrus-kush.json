{"name":"Walrus Kush","description":"While normally difficult to ignore, this Walrus is one sneaky gal. Upon first taste, many users may not feel the Walrus’s effects; however, give it a few minutes and this strain will surprise you in ways you never thought possible. Perhaps slightly indica-dominant, Walrus Kush may not be the best medication for getting things done. Fairly well-balanced, it’s a giggly and sociable strain while providing deep, body-relaxing effects at the same time. Great for users who suffer from stress or migraines, Walrus just might be worth a weekend trip to the dispensary.","flavors":"","lineage":"","grow_metrics":"","attributes_title":"Happy, Giggly, Uplifted, Creative, Hungry, Nausea, Pain, Stress, Depression, Insomnia, Dry Mouth, Headache","attributes_num":"width:100%, width:60%, width:40%, width:40%, width:40%, width:100%, width:100%, width:100%, width:50%, width:50%, width:100%, width:25%"}
