{"name":"Blue Dragon","description":"Thought to have originated in California, Blue Dragon is a cross of two classic strains, the indica-dominant Blueberry and sativa-dominant Sour Diesel. The flowers of this hybrid often turn dark purple and are covered in bright orange pistils and white trichomes. Sometimes measuring over 24% THC, Blue Dragon is very potent, giving users an intensely euphoric feeling and heavy body buzz. Its aroma and flavor are what you might expect given its lineage: equal parts sour fuel and sweet berry with an expansive smoke.","flavors":"1. Berry, 2. Sweet, 3.
