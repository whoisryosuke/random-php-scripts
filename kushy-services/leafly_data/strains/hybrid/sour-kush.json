{"name":"Sour Kush","description":"This cross between Sour Diesel and OG Kush from DNA Genetics is a winning combination. For those looking for daytime pain relief, Sour Kush might be one of the best choices out there. Providing consumers with an uplifting experience without overwhelming sedative effects, this hybrid is great for day-to-day consumption. Sour Kush is slightly sativa-dominant, igniting a giggly and euphoric feeling. The indica effects, however, present themselves a few minutes after consumption. This strain is extremely pungent, so it’s best stored in tightly sealed containers.","flavors":"1. Pungent, 2. Diesel, 3.
