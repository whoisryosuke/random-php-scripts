{"name":"Bubba Tom Hayes","description":"Bubba Tom Hayes is a hybrid that crosses Pre-98 Bubba Kush with a select HazeÂ variety that was bred by Tom Hill. The hybrid tends to be Haze-dominant with a sweet, herb flavor that mixes with musky Kush undertones. The effects tend to be led by the sativa genetics as well, inciting uplifting cerebral activity that eventually fades to a relaxing body effect. The Bubba Kush influence helps speed up the flowering cycle, allowing Bubba Tom Hayes to finish in around 10 weeks when cultivated indoors.","flavors":"1. Earthy, 2. Pungent, 3.
