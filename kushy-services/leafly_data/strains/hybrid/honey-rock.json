{"name":"Honey Rock","description":"Honey Rock by Sumo Seeds is the product of selective breeding and the pursuit of exceptional cannabis. By crossing Super Widow (White Widow x Super Skunk) with Swazi Poison (Swazi x Durban Poison), Sumo Seeds created a rock-hard indica-dominant hybrid that combines landrace genetics with refined hybrids. Honey Rock’s effects are deeply soothing, offering stoney sedation and relief from aches and pains. This is not a daytime strain; the eclectic cannabinoid profile and overall potency make this strain one of Sumo’s heaviest. ","flavors":"","lineage":"","grow_metrics":"","attributes_title":"Sleepy, Euphoric, Giggly, Happy, Hungry, Eye Pressure, Fatigue, Inflammation, Insomnia, Pain, Dizzy, Dry Mouth","attributes_num":"width:100%, width:100%, width:100%, width:100%, width:100%, width:100%, width:100%, width:100%, width:100%, width:100%, width:100%, width:100%"}
