{"name":"BSC","description":"BSC is a hybrid cannabis strain that follows in the footsteps of its Girl Scout Cookies parent, but named for the youthful scouting group's male equivalant. With potent effects that hug the mind and body in tranquil euphoria BSC introduces deep, heavy relaxation throughout the body, but not before making your head reel with calm and happy thoughts. The cerebral buzz tapers down into a foggy daze that helps you abandon worries and slide into a low-key afternoon or a restful night’s sleep. Putting your nose in a jar of BSC isn’t altogether unlike stealing a smell from the cookie jar in your kitchen as sweet, earthy aromas burst forth with subtle notes of woody pine.","flavors":"1.
