{"name":"Alpine Blue","description":"Alpine Blue is a 60/40 sativa-dominant hybrid that combines Blue Mystic and Power Plant, who pass on uplifting euphoric effects alongside a complex aroma of blueberry and woody pine. While some phenotypes tend toward the indica side of the spectrum, even its common sativa expression induces calming full-body effects. Patients typically look to Alpine Blue for daytime relief of anxiety and mood disorders, gastrointestinal pain, and inflammation.","flavors":"1. Berry, 2. Blueberry, 3.
