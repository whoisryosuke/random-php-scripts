{"name":"Ripped Bubba","description":"Ripped Bubba is a 60% indica-dominant hybrid bred by TGA Genetics that crosses a resin-heavy Pre-98 Bubba Kush with the flavorful and euphoric sativa Jack the Ripper. From its sativa parent, Ripped Bubba inherits complex flavoring that blends the sweetness of cherries, blackberries, and lemon with earthy spice. Its other parent, Pre-98 Bubba Kush, passes on its thick trichome coverage and THC-heavy cannabinoid profile. Ripped Bubbaâ€™s potency is not overpowering, but instead promotes functional creativity and focus. Its buds are dense with purple-green hues contrasting against electric orange hairs, and will be ready for harvest 55 to 60 days into its flowering cycle indoors.","flavors":"1. Sweet, 2. Earthy, 3.
