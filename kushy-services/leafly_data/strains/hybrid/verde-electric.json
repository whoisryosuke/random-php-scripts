{"name":"Verde Electric","description":"Verde Electric is one of those strains that is noted for its smooth, unique taste. Bred from a mix of Durban Poison, Platinum OG and Sherbert genes, this strain has gained a following in the medical community for treating pain and digestive issues. The lime green buds should be light, airy and have a nice crystal coat. The buzz is relaxing, but its near 50/50 hybrid mix has enough of an energy jolt to make Verde Electric a choice that works for many both days and nights.","flavors":"1. Pine, 2. Earthy, 3.
