{"name":"Chemdawg 4","description":"Part of the prominent line of Chemdawg strains, Chemdawg 4 is unlike its counterparts as it is indica-dominant. Known to affect users with a head sensation within the first five minutes, the effects can often be full-body. Its smell has been likened to citrus or even Pine-Sol, with a lemon flavor. With light-green buds, Chemdawg 4 grows to be a fairly tall plant, reaching up to 7 feet outdoors and 4-5 feet indoors, and its flowering time is 9-10 weeks. It often appears to have a large amount of crystals, with orange hairs growing from the buds. ","flavors":"1. Diesel, 2. Pine, 3.
