{"name":"Liberty Haze","description":"Liberty Haze is the winner of the 2011 High Times Cannabis Cup and quickly became popular for its fast flowering time and unique taste. Barney’s Farm created this strain by breeding G13 with Chemdawg, the latter of which is known for its quick flowering time. Liberty Haze picked up these traits and this medium tall, bushy plant matures in 8-9 weeks. The buds are lime green heavy with crystals and usually have plenty of red hairs. Users like this strain for its refreshing lime taste and its potency—THC content has been tested at 25%. However, this hybrid has more heady, cerebral effects, making it a popular choice for those treating depression and anxiety.","flavors":"1. Earthy, 2. Citrus, 3.
