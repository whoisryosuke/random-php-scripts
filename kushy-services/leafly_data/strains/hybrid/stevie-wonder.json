{"name":"Stevie Wonder","description":"Stevie Wonder is a sativa-dominant hybrid born from the famed tetrad of Trainwreck, Sensi Star, Bubba Kush, and Blueberry. These large, frosted buds are a patchwork of sage and dark greens, scented with sweet berry and earthy notes. The indica in Stevie Wonder induces a subtle relaxation throughout the body, but even stronger are the uplifted, cerebral-focused effects characteristic of its sativa genes. Patients have reported this strain’s success in treating migraines, nausea, and pain. Stevie Wonder is available through Bodhi seeds or as a clone in the Colorado area. ","flavors":"1. Orange, 2.
