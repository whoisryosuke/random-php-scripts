Bright green in color with a distinct sour apple candy aroma, Sour Apple lives up to its name. You won’t get a sugar rush from this strain, however, but it may leave you stuck on the couch. This indica-dominant hybrid is good for after work or on a lazy afternoon. A cross between Sour Diesel and Cinderella 99, Sour Apple at its best is extremely potent and full-bodied. Try this strain if you’re looking to relax and ease stress.","flavors":"1. Apple, 2. Sweet, 3.
