{"name":"Albert Walker","description":"Albert Walker is an indica-dominant hybrid with unknown origins, but is thought to have descended from Afghan Skunk and bred in the Pacific Northwest. Evidence of its lineage is found in its sour lemon and skunky smell and heavy full-body effects that can last for several hours. Albert Walkerâ€™s euphoric and relaxing qualities make it a go-to strain for patients treating depression and anxiety, and may also have benefits for chronic pain and appetite loss. This clone-only strain may come as a challenge for some growers as the plants tend to require frequent attention and maintenance. However, the high yields following its 8-week flowering cycle could be considered a satisfactory reward.","flavors":"1. Earthy, 2. Lemon, 3.
