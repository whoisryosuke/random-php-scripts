{"name":"Grapefruit Diesel","description":"Grapefruit Diesel is a hybrid strain that is usually indica-dominant but gives most users a focused mental high that is more commonly associated with sativas. The genetics on this one aren’t hard to guess: its parents are Grapefruit and NYC Diesel. These plants show more of their indica side when growing, staying short and branchy and flowering within 8 weeks. Grapefruit Diesel’s flowers sometimes have hints of pink coloring and a potent smell of over ripe citrus fruit. With THC levels between 15 and 20%, the effects should be as strong as the scent. The energetic buzz comes on fast but tends to smooth out over time.","flavors":"1. Grapefruit, 2. Diesel, 3.
