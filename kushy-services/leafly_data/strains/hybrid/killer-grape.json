{"name":"Killer Grape","description":"A cross between Killer Queen and Querkle, Killer Grape is a heavy-handed 50/50 hybrid strain that deals a stupefying blast of cerebral euphoria and deeply relaxing effects. Lavender and purple hues tinge leaves and buds underneath a dusty coat of snow-white resin. This strain from NorStar Genetics gets its name from the sour grape aroma its buds carry, which is accented by spicy, hashy undertones.","flavors":"1. Sweet, 2. Grape, 3.
