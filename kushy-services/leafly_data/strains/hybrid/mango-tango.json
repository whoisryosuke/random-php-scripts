{"name":"Mango Tango","description":"Mango Tango is a hybrid cannabis strain by Elemental Seeds whose crushing indica effects dance with a pungent, fruity flavor profile. Its True OG parent passes on heavily relaxing effects typical of Kush varieties while its loud citrus and peach flavors come from Tangie and Peaches genetics. A subtle pine flavor can be detected on the exhale, creating a complex taste that helped this strain win 1st place in the 2015 SoCal Cannabis Cup.  ","flavors":"1. Mango, 2. Earthy, 3.
