{"name":"Chocolate Drop","description":"Chocolate Drop is the supposed cross of Chocolate Kush and Lowryder. This indica-dominant hybrid produces squat plants with tree-shaped buds that reek of incense, cocoa, pungent earth, and citrus. The effects are relaxing but not overly sedative and offer a kind, uplifting euphoria. Enjoy Chocolate Drop throughout the day to help relieve stress, improve mood, and manage anxiety.","flavors":"1.
