{"name":"Transformer","description":"Transformer by Gage Green Genetics is a combination of Inferno Haze and Joseph OG. This plant grows tall and develops long, spear-like colas. It retains strong citrus and woody aromas while the flavor is hashy on the palate. Transformer finishes flowering in 9 to 11 weeks, and will stretch to about twice its vegetative height. This hybrid has uplifting mental effects and a mid-level body buzz that is good at abating minor aches and pains.    ","flavors":"","lineage":"","grow_metrics":"","attributes_title":"Sleepy, Tingly, Uplifted, Creative, Energetic, Eye Pressure, Dry Eyes, Dry Mouth","attributes_num":"width:100%, width:100%, width:100%, width:100%, width:100%, width:100%, width:100%, width:100%"}
