{"name":"Redding OG","description":"Redding OG is a hybrid strain that won 3rd place in the 2014 Los Angeles Cannabis Cup. Bright orange hairs sprout wildly from the white blanket of frosty crystals that give Redding OG a pale green color. This potent, long-lasting hybrid is energizing enough for social gatherings, but in high doses, Redding OG has the potential to be your dayâ€™s finale. Its high THC content is particularly useful in warding off sleeplessness, appetite loss, depression, and stress.","flavors":"","lineage":"","grow_metrics":"","attributes_title":"Talkative, Euphoric, Giggly, Happy, Hungry, Depression, Insomnia, Lack of Appetite, Nausea, Pain","attributes_num":"width:100%, width:100%, width:100%, width:100%, width:100%, width:100%, width:100%, width:100%, width:100%, width:100%"}
