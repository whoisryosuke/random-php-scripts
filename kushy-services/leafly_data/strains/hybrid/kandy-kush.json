{"name":"Kandy Kush","description":"Kandy Kush is a favorite of DNA Genetics’ Reserva Privada line that combines two California classics, OG Kush (thought to be the “Christopher Wallace” cut) and Trainwreck, to make a tasty indica-dominant hybrid (although sativa phenotypes displaying more of the Trainwreck structure have been noted).  Like the name suggests, the flavor is sweet like candy with a strong lemon-Kush scent.  Very popular with medicinal growers, Kandy Kush provides a potent indica high with pronounced pain relief.","flavors":"1.
