{"name":"Ewok","description":"Ewok, a cross between Albert Walker and Tahoe Alien, was the Hybrid winner of the 2013 Seattle High Times Cannabis Cup. Bred by Alien Genetics, Ewok is a fast-growing plant with a short vegetative cycle, but produces large yields of frost-covered buds as hairy as the Star Wars Ewoks themselves. Pungent fruity notes of tangerine and lemon introduce Ewok’s strong cerebrally-focused effects that promote relaxation and stress relief. The full-body sedation to follow makes this strain a viable option for treatment of pain and insomnia as well. ","flavors":"1. Earthy, 2. Woody, 3.
