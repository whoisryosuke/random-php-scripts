With two powerhouse indica-leaning parents, this strain boasts dense nugs and sweet cherry flavor backed up by hints of diesel and anise. Energetic and uplifting up front, Oteil’s Egyptian Kush provides a blissful body effect that grabs ahold slowly without weighing you down. This strain may be great for pain management, insomnia, happiness, and relaxation.","flavors":"1. Earthy, 2. Pungent, 3.
