{"name":"Purple Diesel","description":"Purple Diesel, bred by Cali Connection, is a wonder among hybrid strains. While most of the effects are similar to traditional sativas (energizing, uplifting, focused), Purple D is also an exceptional strain for pain relief. A sneaky cross between Pre-98 Bubba KushÂ and Sour Diesel, this strain takes a while to fully kick in. However, once the effects begin to present themselves, users are struck by a type of giggly, euphoric bliss. A favorite among daytime users, Purple Diesel features a sour, fuel-like aroma. For those interested in growing, this strain has an early flowering time of around 8 weeks and features dense buds with deep purple leaves.","flavors":"1. Grape, 2. Earthy, 3.
