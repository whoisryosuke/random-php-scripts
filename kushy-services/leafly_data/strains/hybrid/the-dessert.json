{"name":"The Dessert","description":"Known by many names, The Dessert is a CBD-dominant cross of Harlequin and Granddaddy Purple. This earthy, slightly sweet sativa-dominant hybrid has been seen with a 3:1 CBD/THC ratio, slotting it firmly as a medicinal strain while offering enough THC whizbang for recreational cannabis consumers. The Dessert’s effects are lucid, but not stimulating, as well as cozy, but not couch-locked, making it ideal for folks seeking to quash anxiety and minor physical pain.    ","flavors":"","lineage":"","grow_metrics":"","attributes_title":"","attributes_num":""}
