{"name":"Bruce Banner #3","description":"Bruce Banner (probably better-known as the alterÂ ego of comic book superhero The Incredible Hulk) is one of three phenotypes of the Bruce Banner strain and has proven to be a popular one. Effects come on quickly to provide an immediate burst of euphoria before easing into relaxation that may be good for creative pursuits. Delta9 Labs bred this strain from OG Kush and Strawberry Diesel, and its heritage can be found in its diesel aroma with sweet undertones. Its plants flower at 8 to 10 weeks.","flavors":"1. Earthy, 2.
