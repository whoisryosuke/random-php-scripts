{"name":"Star 47","description":"Star 47 sounds like a cosmological address, but it’s actually the combined efforts of Sensi Star and AK-47 to create a hybrid worth sharing. These stains were bred together by World of Seeds (seed) Bank. It exhibits a bright aroma of citrus and pine that is pleasurable all on their own, and the effects are lucid and uplifting while remaining centered in a physical placidity. Enjoy this strain all day, as its effects are chill without freezing you to the couch.   ","flavors":"1. Earthy, 2. Spicy/Herbal, 3.
