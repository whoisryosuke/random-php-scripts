{"name":"Blue Magoo","description":"Blue Magoo, not to be confused with its lookalike Blue Goo, is a clone-only hybrid cross between DJ Short Blueberry and Major League Bud (also known as William’s Wonder F2). A fusion of berry, fruit, and other floral notes make up the aroma and taste of Blue Magoo, resulting in a palate as colorful as its pastel purple and green buds. Blue Magoo is a favorite among patients as it combats a variety of symptoms including pain, nausea, insomnia, anxiety, and appetite loss. This strain delivers a slight sativa kick that helps alleviate the heavy weight of Blue Magoo’s indica effects.","flavors":"1. Blueberry, 2. Sweet, 3.
