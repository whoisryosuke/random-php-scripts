{"name":"Sour Banana Sherbet","description":"This powerful hybrid from Crockett Family Farms is the result of crossing AJâ€™s Sour Diesel with Banana Sherbet. A THC content between 18% and 24% means Sour Banana Sherbet is a heavy hitter, and it reportedly makes excellent concentrates. The terpene profile is a mix of sour fruit and diesel fuel flavors. While it is very easy to grow, it will stretch a great deal, so height management techniques must be employed when growing indoors.","flavors":"1. Sweet, 2. Diesel, 3.
