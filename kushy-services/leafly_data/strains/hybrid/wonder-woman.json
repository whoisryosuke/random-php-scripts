{"name":"Wonder Woman","description":"What makes Wonder Woman so wonderful? If you were to ask growers, they would say it’s the plant’s impressive high yields. If you were to ask users, they would probably cite the length of its sativa dominant buzz. Either way, this strain is a popular lady. Wonder Woman is a possible cross of Ice and another hybrid that can produce both a sativa and an indica dominant plant. Growing-wise, the sativa tends to grow taller than the indica, but both are prized for their very high yields and resilience. On average, plants will flower in 9 to 11 weeks, producing copious amounts of tight little buds that make for easy trimming. The flowers have a mostly skunky smell with notes of fruit and jet fuel that can be stronger or weaker, depending on the plant.","flavors":"1. Pungent, 2. Tropical, 3.
