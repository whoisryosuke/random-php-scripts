{"name":"Grape Stomper","description":"Also called \"Sour Grapes,\" Grape Stomper is a craft hybridstrain created by Gage Green Seeds. A complex cross between breeder JojoRizo’s Purple Elephant and breeder Elite Seeds’ Chemdawg Sour Diesel, Grape Stomper has quite the pedigree. Slightly sativa-dominant, the effects of this strain are felt most in the head. In true hybrid form, however, a pleasant tingly-body sensation usually appears after a few minutes. This is a sociable strain that's for consumers who would like pain relief while out and about. As the name suggests, Grape Stomper also features a strong, fruity aroma similar to grape candy. ","flavors":"1. Grape, 2. Diesel, 3.
