{"name":"Russian Rocket Fuel","description":"Russian Rocket Fuel is the hybrid product of a cross between NYC Diesel and an unknown indica. Typically flowering in 8-10 weeks, this strain is a moderately easy grow for both indoor and outdoor plots. While this strain is perfect for easing stomach pain and increasing appetite, most of its effects are felt in the head. Euphoric and focused, Russian Rocket Fuelâ€™s sativa effects are felt upon first taste. Like many other hybrids, however, the indica body-heavy sensation presents itself over time. As its name suggests, this strain also features a pungent, fuel-like aroma.","flavors":"1. Spicy/Herbal, 2. Menthol, 3.
