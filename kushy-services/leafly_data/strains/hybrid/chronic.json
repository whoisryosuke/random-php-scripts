{"name":"Chronic","description":"The word \"chronic\" has become a commonplace descriptor of high-quality marijuana, but this Chronic is a balanced hybrid cross between Northern Lights, Skunk, and AK-47 originally bred by Serious Seeds in 1994. The AK-47 was later introduced to the genetic mix to increase its resin content and effect complexity without diminishing yields. Sweet honey, flower, and spice color the aroma of this renowned hybrid, but take extra care during the drying process: its delicate scent is easily lost. Chronic forms massive colas with very few leaves, so topping this high-yielder isn't advisable. ","flavors":"1. Skunk, 2. Woody, 3.
