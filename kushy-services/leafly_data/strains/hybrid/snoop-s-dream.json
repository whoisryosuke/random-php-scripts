{"name":"Snoop's Dream","description":"Snoop Dogg is a hip-hop superstar who has quite a bit of fame in the cannabis community. Given his status, Snoop’s Dream is a strain that has a big name to live up to and this indica-dominant hybrid does not disappoint. Snoop’s Dream is a mix of Blue Dream and Master Kush, which are purportedly two of the rapper’s favorites. Looks-wise, these plants and flowers take after their Blue Dream parent with medium-sized dense buds covered in orange hairs. The taste is where the kush side of this strain shows itself. Sweet blueberry flavors are there with a pine aftertaste that takes over. This hybrid has a strong indica side for sure and may make doing any focused task difficult. Head effects can also be strong, making this a choice that beginners might want to work up to. Tests have shown samples of Snoop’s Dream have high THC levels ranging between 18 and 22%.","flavors":"1. Earthy, 2. Blueberry, 3.
