{"name":"Harmony","description":"Harmony is a hybrid that synchronizes the very best of its three parent strains, Santa Marta Colombian Gold, LemonÂ OG Kush, and Lemon Thai. These tall plants produce flowery, lemon-smelling buds distinctly kush-like in structure. Its effects are invigorating and uplifting, but higher doses might push you into a more spacey experience. Indoor growers wait 8 to 9 weeks for Harmony to flower while outdoor cultivators prepare for harvest in the month of October.","flavors":"1. Citrus, 2. Woody, 3.
