{"name":"White Fire OG","description":"White Fire OG, also known as WiFi OG, is a 60% sativa hybrid with uplifting and comfortable cerebrally focused effects. This strain combines the best features of its parent strains: the sour, earthy, diesel aroma of Fire OG and the high resin production of The White that leaves the plants covered in a dusty snowfall of crystals. Many phenotypes of White Fire OG exist, some with dense, barrel-like buds and others with pointed, conic formations. Daytime use of this strain wonâ€™t leave the consumer drowsy, making it a good choice for social and creative activities. White Fire OG is often chosen by patients to treat anxiety and depression, cancer, glaucoma, pain, and appetite loss. Growers of White Fire OG can raise their high-yielding plants outdoors or inside with a 65-day flowering period.","flavors":"1. Earthy, 2. Pungent, 3.
