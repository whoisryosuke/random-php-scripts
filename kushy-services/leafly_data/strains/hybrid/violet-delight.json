{"name":"Violet Delight","description":"Violet Delight is an indica-dominant strain that delivers exactly what its name promises: a loud burst of floral flavor that can only be compared to the aroma of a violet. Glance at this hybrid’s terpene profile and you’ll notice high levels of linalool, a flowery-smelling terpene that promotes relaxation and stress-relief. While driven by indica genetics, Violet Delight isn’t overwhelmingly sedating for most consumers. Instead, you’ll likely find yourself in a clear, focused headspace conducive for meditation or introverted activities. For the extroverts, this hybrid offers a giggly, lighthearted mood that keeps you active and engaged in social settings.","flavors":"1. Sweet, 2. Violet, 3.
