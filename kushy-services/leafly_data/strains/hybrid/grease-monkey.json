{"name":"Grease Monkey","description":"Grease Monkey is a sweet, earthy strain with strong skunky overtones. Created by Exotic Genetix, Grease Monkey is a cross of Gorilla Glue #4 x Cookies and Cream. This strain’s indica-dominant genetics saddle the consumer with a lazy, munchie-fueled body buzz that softens the blow of chronic pain, nausea, and stress. While defined as a hybrid, this Grease Monkey’s deep relaxation will naturally lead some consumers toward sleep, so mind your dosage.   ","flavors":"1. Pungent, 2. Earthy, 3.
