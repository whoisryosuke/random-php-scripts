{"name":"J1","description":"J1, or Jack One, is a high-end hybrid strain that is gaining widespread popularity. Although a hybrid, the high-energy effects categorize the strain more on the sativa end of the scale. J1 is a cross between two famous sativas, Skunk #1 and Jack Herer, and is best known for its strong, uplifting, clear-headed buzz that allows for mobility. The flowers are emerald green and frosty with a sweet aroma resembling the unmistakable Jack Herer pungency. This strainâ€™s seemingly only flaw is the top-shelf price that tends to come with its exceptional quality.","flavors":"1. Citrus, 2. Skunk, 3.
