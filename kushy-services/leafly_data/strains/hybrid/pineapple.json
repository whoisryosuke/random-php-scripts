{"name":"Pineapple","description":"Pineapple was developed by selecting a phenotype of Ed Rosenthalâ€™s Super Bud (ERSB) that expressed predominantly indica traits and had intense tropical flavors. After generations of inbreeding, the strain developed a sturdy structure and more pronounced flavors of pineapple and diesel. The buds take on a bulbous shape that, in a way, resemble the fruit. A perfect strain for stress relief, Pineapple will transport you to your happy place, leaving you uplifted and relaxed.","flavors":"1. Pineapple, 2. Tropical, 3.
