{"name":"Citrus Kush","description":"Citrus Kush is a fresh and fruity blast for the senses. As the name implies, this indica-dominant hybrid has a deep citrus aroma with darker, muskier tones that support the theory of some Master Kush genetics. The taste follows suit with a sweet and sour mix that will bring to mind a bright bowl of lemons, limes, and oranges. Citrus Kushâ€™s effects will be strong in both the head and body, providing a mood boost that leaves consumers happy (if a little out of it).","flavors":"1. Citrus, 2. Sweet, 3.
