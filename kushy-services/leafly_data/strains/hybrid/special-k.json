{"name":"Special K","description":"Special K is a hybrid cross between sativa Western Winds and indica Slyder. The plant is tall with substantial girth, despite its lanky indica influence, with elongated buds. The effects are long-lasting with a quick onset, beginning with a physical buzz and evolving into a heady lift that borders on psychedelic. Special K has been called adventureful, making it a wonderful daytime strain. Indoor or outdoor grows can expect to flower at around 10 weeks.","flavors":"1. Sweet, 2. Citrus, 3.
