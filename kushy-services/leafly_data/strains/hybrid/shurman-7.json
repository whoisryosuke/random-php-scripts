{"name":"Shurman #7","description":"Shurman #7 by Solstice won Best CBD Flower at the 2017 Dope Cup in Seattle, WA. This phenomenal strain was a happy accident brought forth from the phenotypes created from Solstice’s highest THC strains, Blueberry Cheesecake and The White. Possessing a surprisingly robust terpene profile for a CBD-dominant strain, Shurman #7 expresses sweet and savory notes that coat the palate. Shurman #7 has a 2:1 CBD/THC ratio and was named after the cofounder's dog, friend, and companion, Shurman. ","flavors":"1. Sweet, 2.
