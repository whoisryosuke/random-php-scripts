{"name":"Lemon Drop","description":"Lemon Drop is a mellow, fluffy bud that provides a pleasant, giggly sensation. This strain tends to provide a more euphoric, focused experience, though indica-dominant variations exist and produce a stronger body feeling that is relaxing yet not overpowering. Fittingly, Lemon Drop has a lemony, clean taste that is reminiscent of the candy of the same name.","flavors":"1. Lemon, 2. Citrus, 3.
