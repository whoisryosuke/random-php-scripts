{"name":"Strawberry Kush","description":"Strong and sweet, Strawberry Kush is one well-rounded lady. Featuring a musky imitation strawberry taste, this strain lives up to its lineage. Typically found as a cross between the sweet Strawberry Cough and the pungent OG Kush, Strawberry Kush is strong but not overpowering. A potent indica for novice consumers, itâ€™s a sleepy strain that produces a calming heavy body sensation. The genetics for this strain may vary by dispensary. Some dispensaries carry more hybrid or sativa-dominant versions, which may produce opposite, energizing effects. For growers, Strawberry Kush is available by clone only and typically flowers between 8 and 9 weeks.","flavors":"1. Strawberry, 2. Sweet, 3.
