{"name":"Burmese Kush","description":"This hybrid strain is almost half sativa and tends to give users a calm, mellow outlook. Bred by TH Seeds as a cross that includes the California classic, OG Kush, this plant will be dark green and have a piney aroma with a sweet aftertaste. Growth can be slow to start so Burmese Kush is best for indoor conditions where growth speeds up and plants flower in 7-8 weeks. The effects also tend to come on slowly but can be strong and long-lasting once they do.","flavors":"1. Earthy, 2. Sweet, 3.
