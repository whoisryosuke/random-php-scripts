{"name":"Blue Widow","description":"Blue Widow is a favorite strain that provides consumers with both uplifting and calming effects. These flowers will have a strong sweet aroma that may also include sour citrus or pine. The buds can be colorful, with tints of blue and purple, and should have a coat of long orange hairs. Slightly indica-dominant, this Widow plays against type, growing taller than most indicas and providing more mental, heady effects. In higher doses, the blissful relaxation this strain provides may lead to drowsiness and help you get to sleep. A cross between Blueberry and White Widow, Blue Widow is sometimes also called Berry White, White Berry, and Blue Venom.","flavors":"1. Blueberry, 2. Sweet, 3.
