{"name":"Chemdawg 91","description":"Much like many other members of the Chemdawg line, the origins of Chemdawg 91 are shrouded in mystery. Rumor has it that the lineage was first cultivated by the illustrious East Coast breeder who also goes by the name of Chemdawg, and some speculate it descends from a Thai landrace strain. Chemdawg 91 is thought to be an offshoot of the original Chemdawg strain, and the numerical addition of “91” is believed to reference the year the strain first came into existence.Some growers believe Chemdawg 91 to be a cross between Chemdawg and Skunk, which may explain its particularly pungent aroma. In true family spirit, this hybrid has a very strong diesel smell with a piney-lemon aftertaste. Most Chemdawg 91 crops tend to lean sativa, though you may find indica variants on some dispensary and retail shelves. Consumers should expect a cerebral buzz from this strain. ","flavors":"1.
