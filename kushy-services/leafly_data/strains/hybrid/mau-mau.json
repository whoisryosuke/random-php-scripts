{"name":"Mau-Mau","description":"Mau-Mau is a hybrid from Irie Vibe Seeds that crosses an indica-dominant Blockhead female with a Killer Queen male. The strain was named as a tribute to a street artist from the UK with the same name, and after experiencing the buds himself, Mau-Mau decided to design the original packaging for the seeds. This hybrid is sturdy and easy to grow, finishing in 8 to 9 weeks.","flavors":"","lineage":"","grow_metrics":"","attributes_title":"Uplifted, Happy, Creative, Energetic, Euphoric, Fatigue, Insomnia, Muscle Spasms, Nausea, Stress, Dry Mouth","attributes_num":"width:100%, width:100%, width:50%, width:50%, width:50%, width:100%, width:100%, width:100%, width:100%, width:100%, width:100%"}
