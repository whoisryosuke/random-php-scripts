{"name":"White Russian","description":"Originally created by Dutch breeders Serious Seeds, White Russian is a cross of two legendary strains, White Widow and AK-47. An indica-dominant hybrid, it won the High Times Cannabis Cup \"Best Overall\" in 1996 and was for a time considered the strongest strain in the world at 22% THC. Presenting remarkable homogeneity for an f1 hybrid, White Russian is an extremely fragrant plant, smelling of sweet fruit and skunk even in its vegetative cycle. With a flavor that is smooth and spicy with undertones of skunk and earth, White Russian’s high is quite cerebral (especially for an indica), but can lead to couchlock when over-indulged.","flavors":"1.
