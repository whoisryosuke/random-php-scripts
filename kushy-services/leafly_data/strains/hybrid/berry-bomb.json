{"name":"Berry Bomb","description":"Berry Bomb is a hybrid cross between Blueberry and Bomb #1 that shows off its indica-leaning genetics through powerful sedation. A sweet blueberry and earthy pine flavor launches you into Berry Bombâ€™s potent full-body effects, which can easily help you transition into a restful night or an afternoon nap. According to its breeders at Bomb Seeds, Berry Bomb sometimes expresses itself in cool hues of blue in lower temperatures. Its flowers explode into growth early on, stretching especially tall in outdoor gardens. Berry Bomb thrives in screen of green (SCROG) setups, and indoor plants finish their flowering in a short 6 to 8 weeks.","flavors":"1. Berry, 2. Sweet, 3.
