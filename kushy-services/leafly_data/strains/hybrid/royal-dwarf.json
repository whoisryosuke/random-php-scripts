{"name":"Royal Dwarf","description":"Royal Dwarf is a full-body hybrid bred by Royal Queen Seeds in Spain through crossing Skunk with a cannabis ruderalis variety. The result is a stout plant that autoflowers in a short 6 to 7 weeks with dark, crystal-sugared buds. Its effects quickly branch throughout the body, inducing head-to-toe relaxation thatâ€™s more physical than cerebral.","flavors":"1. Skunk, 2. Honey, 3.
