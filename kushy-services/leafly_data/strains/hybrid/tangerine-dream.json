{"name":"Tangerine Dream","description":"This winner of the 2010 Cannabis Cup was created by the illustrious Barneyâ€™s Farm. A strain for connoisseurs, Tangerine Dream is the hybrid daughter of G13, Afghani, and Neville's A5 Haze. Its ability to knock out pain while increasing energy is what makes Tangerine Dream so special. While too much Tangerine Dream may leave you stuck on the couch, this strain was handcrafted to meet the demands of working medical patients. Uplifting and euphoric, it provides users with mental clarity while deeply relaxing muscles. Tangerine Dream typically flowers in 8 to 10 weeks and features a citrusy aroma.","flavors":"1. Citrus, 2.
