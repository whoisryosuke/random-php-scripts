{"name":"Pineapple Trainwreck","description":"Bring together the popular clear-headed effects of Pineapple Express and the pain relief qualities of Trainwreck and you get this happy sativa. Pineapple Trainwreck has an earthy aroma and a fruity flavor that usually takes more after its pineapple parent. Long-lasting and potent, this strain hits hard at first, but mellows into a state where being sociable or getting things done is possible. The buzz tends to be more mellow than active, though, so donâ€™t be surprised if verbal activity is all you get around to.","flavors":"1. Pineapple, 2. Earthy, 3.
