{"name":"Gorilla Glue #5","description":"Available exclusively at California's CannaCruz, Gorilla Glue #5 from GG Strains is a potent hybrid that crosses Gorilla Glue #1 and Gorilla Glue #4 phenotypes. True to its name, GG #5 is known to leave its consumer “glued” to the couch in deep relaxation. With a strong diesel flavor, Gorilla Glue #5 delivers stupefying effects that are reported to be heavier than either parent strains, so patients looking for a good sleep aid, muscle relaxant, or pain reliever should keep this one on their radar. GG #5 grows as a branchy plant with Kush-like buds.","flavors":"1. Earthy, 2. Diesel, 3.
