{"name":"Cherry Pie Kush","description":"Cherry Pie Kush (not to be confused with Cherry Pie) is essentially a Cherry Pie cross of Durban Poison and Granddaddy Purple, infused with the California native, San Fernando Valley OG. Some folks claim this strain came before Cherry Pie and others say it’s a product of Cookie Fam’s famous hybrid lineage. With bright cerebral effects that stilt the heavy weight on the limbs, this strain functions as medical-grade all-day flower, soothing physical discomfort without being overly sedative. Expect earthy and tart notes that linger in the air and coat the palate in a pungent, velvety vapor.   ","flavors":"1. Berry, 2. Sweet, 3.
