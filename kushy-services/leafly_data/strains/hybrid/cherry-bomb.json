{"name":"Cherry Bomb","description":"Cherry Bomb is a popular marijuana strain thanks to its reputation as a great hybrid that provides mild to moderate effects that are appropriate for daytime consumption. Their bright green flowers do take off fast, giving many consumers that telltale pressure behind the eyes that's usually an indicator of a strong sativa buzz to come. The immediate effects are active and mentally alert, but can border on antsy for some. This feeling tends to smooth into a more focused state that allows for normal activities and may even help you tackle that to-do list or next creative project. The genetics of this strain are dependent on which version you get, but a popular variant is a cross between a California indica (most likely with some Skunk lineage) and a Hawaiian sativa that was created by breeders at Barney’s Farms. Cherry Bomb’s flowers will have a musky, berry aroma and a mild but similar flavor.","flavors":"1. Citrus, 2. Flowery, 3.
