{"name":"Tangenesia","description":"Tangenesia is a heady bud crafted from even headier parent strains, Tangerine Haze and Ghiesel Amnesia Haze. This strain is a rare gathering of sweet sativa-dominant elements that offer cerebral clarity cloaked in a hazy aura, making it ideal for zoning out on repetitive tasks or binge watching television. The aroma is that of fruit and herbs with a pleasant sweetness on the exhale. Utilize Tangenesia to combat fatigue, stress, and depression.Â ","flavors":"","lineage":"","grow_metrics":"","attributes_title":"","attributes_num":""}
