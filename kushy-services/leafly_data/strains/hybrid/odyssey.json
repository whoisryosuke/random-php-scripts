{"name":"Odyssey","description":"Odyssey is a well-balanced hybrid strain that originated in San Francisco and quickly became popular in the Bay Area. This strain flowers at 7 to 8 weeks, producing large, dense buds that have a sweet, sugary aroma. Its candy flavor is best appreciated through a vaporizer and provides strong head-based effects. Some head pressure is common, but this strainâ€™s indica side comes out later, leading to a body-melting calm. Overall, Odyssey will take you on a smooth journey.","flavors":"1. Sweet, 2. Skunk, 3.
