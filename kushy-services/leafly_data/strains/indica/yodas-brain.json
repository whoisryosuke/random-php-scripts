{"name":"Yoda's Brain","description":"Yoda’s Brain is an indica-dominant cut with dense, crystal-coated buds rich with potency. Due to its high THC content, Yoda’s Brain exhibits a sativa-dominant rush to the head off the get-go. This powerful sizzle in the brain simmers down and wraps the body in a weighted aura some might consider meditative. It has a slightly floral aroma with overtones of earth and spices. Enjoy Yoda’s Brain near the end of the day to amplify its relaxing, sedative effects.   ","flavors":"1. Sage, 2. Pungent, 3.
