{"name":"Blue Dynamite","description":"Blue Dynamite, bred by Next Generation Seeds in Canada, is an indica-dominant strain that provides heavy mind-and-body relaxation alongside a fruity, hashy flavor. This powerhouse indica was bred from a B.C. Grapefruit clone known as Dynamite and an Afghani-Blueberry hybrid called Avalon. Combining the flavorful qualities of Dynamite with the resinous potential Avalon enables, we are left with a potent strain that can budge even the most stubborn cases of pain, nausea, and sleeplessness. High Times recognized Blue Dynamite among its Top 10 Strains of 2007, solidifying a reputation that keeps this strain firmly set in the cannabis market.","flavors":"1. Citrus, 2. Lemon, 3.
