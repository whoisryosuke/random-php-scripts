{"name":"Blueberry Skunk","description":"Blueberry Skunk is an indica-dominant hybrid of Blueberry and Skunk #1 with definite sativa tendencies. Skunk #1’s vigor, yield, and reliability are preserved, and Blueberry brings to the mix its heavy resin production and sweet berry flavors blended with an earthy, skunky musk. During flowering, most plants double or triple their vegetated height, with fat, resin-crusted buds closing the gaps between internodes. The effects are led by a long-lasting euphoric buzz that generates giggles as well as the munchies.","flavors":"1. Blueberry, 2. Berry, 3.
