{"name":"Querkle","description":"A cross between Purple Urkle and Space Queen, Querkle from TGA Genetics is an 80/20 indica-dominant strain that carries a strong grape and berry aroma. Querkle blooms with vibrant lavender hues and a heavy dusting of crystal resin that blankets its bulky colas in a frost-like coat. Heavily euphoric and cerebral, Querkle may be used during the day but is ideal for evening use as it relaxes muscles and guides the mind into sleep.","flavors":"1. Sweet, 2. Earthy, 3.
