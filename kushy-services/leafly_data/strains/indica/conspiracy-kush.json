{"name":"Conspiracy Kush","description":"Conspiracy Kush by Heroes of the Farm GeneticsÂ is a 70/30 indica-dominant cross of Obama Kush and Space Queen. The dense, trichome-frosted flowers produce a tangy citrus aroma and a peppery aftertaste. The influence of Space Queen is felt immediately with a Haze-like sense of cerebral activity, but shortly after the relaxing indica effects take hold and provide calming relaxation perfect for unwinding at the end of the day.","flavors":"1.
