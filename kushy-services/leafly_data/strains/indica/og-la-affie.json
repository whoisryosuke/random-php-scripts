{"name":"OG LA Affie","description":"OG LA Affie from DNA Genetics is a pure indica variety best known for parenting the famed LA Confidential. This indica powerhouse is chosen by many patients treating pain and insomnia because, unlike many other pure indica strains, OG LA Affie provides swift relief without inevitable sedation. Instead, it offers an unusually energetic and psychedelic buzz that makes you wonder how a sativa never made it into the genetic mix. The aroma is a subtle blend of earthy and sweet, similar to that of its LA Confidential offspring.","flavors":"1. Earthy, 2. Pepper, 3.
