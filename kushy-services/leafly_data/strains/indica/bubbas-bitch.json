{"name":"Bubba's Bitch","description":"Bubba’s Bitch is a proprietary cross from Garrett Gardens out of Dewitt, Michigan. This indica-dominant hybrid is a lovingly handcrafted cross of Bubba Kush and 517 Headband, which was then backcrossed for stability and potency. It inherits both parents’ aromas, reeking of diesel and skunk with a slight fruitiness intermixed. When combusted, the exhale is earthy and smooth, leading to relaxing, painkilling effects that are suited for conquering migraines, restlessness, or loss of appetite. ","flavors":"","lineage":"","grow_metrics":"","attributes_title":"","attributes_num":""}
