{"name":"Sugar Black Rose","description":"Sugar Black Rose is a cross of Critical MassÂ and Black Domina bred by Delicious Seeds. An indica-dominant hybrid, Sugar Black Rose has a sweet taste with hints of fruit and fresh flowers. The aroma takes on a pungent, earthy musk that resembles exotic hash imported from overseas, and brings with it a relaxing body buzz that helps keep nausea, anxiety, and muscle pains at bay.","flavors":"1.
