{"name":"Alien Technology","description":"Very little is known about Alien Technology other than it is a landrace strain selected from a handful of seeds acquired by breeder OBSoul33t from a US soldier returning from Afghanistan. It is a pure indica that features light green buds, incredible trichome production, and a spicy, hashy flavor/aroma with fuel undertones. Reports indicate that the high is more stimulating than your typical indica, while lasting as long as 6 hours. Alien Technology has been used in breeding some of todayâ€™s most potent hybrids such as Alien Dawg and Alien Kush.","flavors":"1. Spicy/Herbal, 2. Woody, 3.
