{"name":"Supergirl","description":"Nirvana Seeds created Supergirl by backcrossing the famous Skunk #1 and focusing on the indica portion of that strainâ€™s genetics. This 80% indica produces large rock-hard buds, tons of resin, and a strong, skunky and coffee odor. Although containing a relatively mild THC content between 8% and 15%, the high is fast and hard-hitting, leaving the user fully relaxed and unable to focus. A good choice for treating insomnia, Supergirl has sedating effects that help your eyes ease shut.","flavors":"1. Earthy, 2. Woody, 3.
