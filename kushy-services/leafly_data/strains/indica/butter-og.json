{"name":"Butter OG","description":"While there is not much information available on the origins of Butter OG, it is generally thought to be an indica-dominant strain as it gives consumersÂ a very relaxing, giggly high that gradually fades to sleepiness. Its dense, sparkly buds give off a fruity scent with slight undertones of ammonia. The smoke is very light and smooth, with sweet flavors on the inhale and, like its name suggests, a buttery aftertaste. Butter OG is potentially beneficial for treating pain, anxiety, depression, and insomnia.","flavors":"1. Butter, 2. Sweet, 3.
