{"name":"P-51","description":"P-51 is a piney, earthy indica strain that crosses a Tahoe OG male and a Blackberry mother. Created by Clint Pipkin, a grower in both Humboldt County and Northwestern Washington, the male was flowered in a window sill on the Key Peninsula in Pierce County. Thousands of seeds were created during this cross, and Washington producer Rootworx narrowed this strain down to the best cut from 70 phenotypes. This has become Rootworx’s signature strain, resulting in DOPE Magazine’s “Strain of the Month” in June 2015. This deeply relaxing indica has also been deemed “The Tranquilizer Dart” in recreational retail shops throughout Washington state.","flavors":"1. Earthy, 2. Spicy/Herbal, 3.
