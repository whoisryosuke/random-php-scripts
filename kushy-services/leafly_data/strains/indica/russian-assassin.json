{"name":"Russian Assassin","description":"Russian Assassin, also known as Russian Assassin OG, is an indica-dominant hybrid that crosses Skywalker, Lemon OG Kush, and Headband. The resulting buds are large, chunky, and covered in trichomes with dark red pistils throughout. Russian Assassinâ€™s piney fragrance shifts to a minty flavor on exhale and produces a rush of tingly cerebral activity that is felt immediately before giving way to a powerful, relaxing body buzz.","flavors":"1.
