{"name":"Cactus","description":"First bred by Jordan of the Islands, Cactus is an indica cross between Afghani and Northern Lights and is named after its vague resemblance to the pear cactus. Cactus buds are conic with knobby formations and emit an organic earthy aroma with citrus notes. This indica is an adept painkiller, providing relief to aches and sore muscles as well as spasms and anxiety. While its indica genetics prepare us for a sleepy, relaxed experience, many describe Cactus as having more uplifting, energizing effects characteristic of sativa strains. Cactus has become a popular staple among the connoisseurs of Seattle, and was among the first place winners in the 2012 High Times Cannabis Cup.","flavors":"1.
