{"name":"Phantom Arrow","description":"Phantom Arrow by Cereal Killer Genetics is another smelly treat from Shaman Stinky Steve. This indica-dominant cross of Purple Arrow and Phantom Kush is a powerful medicine for consumers suffering from anxiety, migraines, and chronic pain. Phantom Arrowâ€™s stoney body effects settle behind the eyes and the forehead while seeping into the extremities as a subtle, calming warmth. The bouquet is a delicate arrangement of champagne, eucalyptus, cherry, and floral undertones that coat the palate on the exhale.","flavors":"1. Tree Fruit, 2. Menthol, 3.
