{"name":"Extreme OG","description":"Extreme OG, bred by Exotic Genetix, is a potent yet functional indica built from the genetics of Fire OG and Green Ribbon. While Fire OG maintains chunky, weighted body effects, this strain stays uplifted thanks to the dominant Green Crack genetics inside Green Ribbon. In small doses, this strain places pleasant relaxation in the body while leaving the mind alert. But be warned, continuous consumption compounds this strain's indica effects, leading to couch lock and appetite ignition.    ","flavors":"1. Lime, 2. Earthy, 3.
