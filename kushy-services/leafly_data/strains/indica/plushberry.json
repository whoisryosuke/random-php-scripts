{"name":"Plushberry","description":"Plushberry, a cross between Black Cherry Soda and Space Queen, is an 80% indica strain bred by TGA Seeds. The Black Cherry Soda lends this strain an aromatic berry scent, while the Space Queen genetics promote heavy resin production. Plushberry induces a deep relaxation in the mind and body, with calming qualities that melt away stress. There are two main phenotypes of Plushberry: one that grows smaller, pink-tinted plants, and another with bulkier, more indica-like formations. Plushberry flowers in 55 to 65 days with medium to heavy yields. ","flavors":"1. Berry, 2. Sweet, 3.
