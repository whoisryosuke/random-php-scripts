{"name":"Wembley","description":"Wembley by Pyramid Seeds is an indica-dominant strain created by combining AK-47 and Bubble Gum. This fruity strain has a stable, solid morphology that is typically low to the ground and flowers in about 60 days. Its long-lasting relaxation pairs nicely with AK-47â€™s heady sizzle, giving Wembly an immersive physical sensation that sticks to the bones. Enjoy Wembley to improve mood while tempering minor physical pain.","flavors":"","lineage":"","grow_metrics":"","attributes_title":"","attributes_num":""}
