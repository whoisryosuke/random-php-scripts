The strain’s Monster Cookies x Yeti OG x Bloo's Kloos heritage boasts large yields and potency well over 20% THC. Double Tap’s Bloo's Kloos ancestry also gives this strain sweet and aromatic flavors of berry, pine, grape, and fuel. This heavy indica should be consumed sparingly. As the name implies, Double Tap takes you out and puts you down, leaving the body sedated and the mind relaxed.","flavors":"","lineage":"","grow_metrics":"","attributes_title":"Talkative, Happy, Relaxed","attributes_num":"width:100%, width:100%, width:100%"}
