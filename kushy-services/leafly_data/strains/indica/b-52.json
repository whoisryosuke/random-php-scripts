{"name":"B-52","description":"B-52 is a 75/25 indica-dominant cross between Skunk and Big Bud. This hybrid by Nirvana Seeds is a sweet mix of skunky flavors that have remarkable cerebral effects for a strain that leans towards the indica end of the spectrum. It is a great strain for commercial production but its unique heady effects are enjoyed by connoisseurs and those with an affinity towards the Skunk family tree. A great strain for the relaxing while watching a movie, B-52 will leave you giggling and flying high.","flavors":"1. Earthy, 2. Sweet, 3.
