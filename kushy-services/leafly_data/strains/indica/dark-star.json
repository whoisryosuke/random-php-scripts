{"name":"Dark Star","description":"Dark Star’s true indica effects are as spacey as its name suggests: a deep, relaxed sensation throughout the body accompanied by a heavy cerebral calm. Though celestial in its effects, the strain is more likely homage to the Grateful Dead’s song “Dark Star.” A cross between Purple Kush and Mazar-I-Sharif, Dark Star is a CBD-rich indica ideal for treating pain and anxiety. This dark--almost bluish--strain was first bred indoors by TH Seeds, and comes as a challenge to many growers with its slow, 10-week flowering period. Its sour-smelling buds are dense and compact, ornamented with crystals and copper hairs. ","flavors":"1. Earthy, 2. Pine, 3.
