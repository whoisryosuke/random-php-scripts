{"name":"Purple Wreck","description":"Purple Wreck is the offspring of two very popular strains, Purple Urkle and Trainwreck, and was created by Amsterdamâ€™s DNA genetics. The cross sped up the growth time of the usually slow Urkle, and Purple Wreck plants can be expected to flower quickly in 8-9 weeks. The resulting buds are usually dense and plentiful, making this strain a favorite of growers. These flowers tend to smell both sweet and grassy and taste the same, with the sweet notes of the Purple Urkle dominating.","flavors":"1. Grape, 2. Sweet, 3.
