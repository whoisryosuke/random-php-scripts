{"name":"Mazar I Sharif","description":"A legendary strain grown in the far north of Afghanistan.  In fertile and well-irrigated soils these vigorous giants are capable of reaching 4 metres in height or more, and will produce a similarly immense yield of intensely resinous flowers.  Over-indulgence produces a mind-warping, immobilising and narcotic effect. One of this strain's phenotypes has been described as producing \"very potent physical relaxation\"; this is likely to be indicative of high CBD levels.","flavors":"1. Earthy, 2. Woody, 3.
