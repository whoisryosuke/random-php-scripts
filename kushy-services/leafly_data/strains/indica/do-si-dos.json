{"name":"Do-Si-Dos","description":"Do-Si-Dos is an indica-dominant hybrid with qualities similar to its parent, Girl Scout Cookies. With glittering trichomes, bright pistils, and lime green and lavender leaves, this strain is a feast for eyes. Its aroma is pungent, sweet, and earthy with slight floral funkiness. These classic OG aromas blend nicely with medical-grade body effects that lean toward the sedative side with the addition of Face Off OG genetics. Enjoy a stoney, in-your-face buzz off the start that melts down over the body, prettifying the consumer with relaxation that emanates outward.Â ","flavors":"1. Earthy, 2. Sweet, 3.
