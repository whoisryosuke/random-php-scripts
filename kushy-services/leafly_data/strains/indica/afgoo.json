{"name":"Afgoo","description":"Afgoo, also known as Afgooey, is a potent indica strain that is believed to descend from an Afghani indica and Maui Haze.Â Its sativa parent may lend Afgoo some uplifting, creative qualities, but this strain undoubtedly takes after its indica parent as it primarily delivers relaxing, sleepy effects alongside its earthy pine flavor. Growers hoping to cultivate Afgoo may have a better chance of success indoors, but this indica can also thrive in Mediterranean climates outdoors.","flavors":"1. Pine, 2. Earthy, 3.
